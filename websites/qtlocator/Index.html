  <h2>About QTLocator</h2>
  Genetic dissection of complex traits has proven to be an efficient approach to dissect 
  and understand the involved mechanisms. The increasing availability of experimental 
  crosses and tools to perform high-throughput phenotyping has dramatically increased 
  the rate of data production and now demands for new bioinformatics tools that can 
  handle this amount of data. Here, we describe QTLocator, a new tool that performs 
  automated QTL analysis on large datasets using the open source statistical framework R.
  It can efficiently summarize QTL locations, effects and possible interactions.<br>

  <h2>About R and R/qtl</h2>
  <h3>R</h3>
  R is an open-source implementation of the S language. As described on the <a href='http://www.r-project.org/'>R project homepage</a>:<br><br>
  <q>R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a 
  run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and 
  the ability to run programs stored in script files.</q><br><br>

  <q>The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as
  well as modular programming using functions. Most of the user-visible functions in R are 
  written in R. It is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the C, 
  C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency. The R distribution contains functionality for 
  a large number of statistical procedures. Among these are: linear and generalized linear 
  models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical parametric and 
  nonparametric tests, clustering and smoothing. There is also a large set of functions 
  which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
  presentations. Additional modules are available for a variety of specific purposes.</q><br><br>

  R is freely available for Windows, Unix and MacOS, and may be downloaded from the 
  <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html'>Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</a>.
  <h3>R/qtl</h3>
  <a href='http://www.rqtl.org/'>A software package</a> for the R language developed by prof. Karl W Broman (and others):<br><br>
  <q>R/qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in 
  experimental crosses. It is implemented as an add-on package for the freely available and 
  widely used statistical language/software R (see the R project homepage). The development 
  of this software as an add-on to R allows us to take advantage of the basic mathematical 
  and statistical functions, and powerful graphics capabilities, that are provided with R. 
  Further, the user will benefit by the seamless integration of the QTL mapping software 
  into a general statistical analysis program. Our goal is to make complex QTL mapping 
  methods widely accessible and allow users to focus on modeling rather than computing.</q><br><br>
