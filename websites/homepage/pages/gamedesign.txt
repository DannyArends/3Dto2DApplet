<h1>Game design</h1>
<p>
One of my longest hobbies, computer games and how 2D / 3D rendering engines work inspired 
me to create my own <a href="http://www.github.com/DannyArends/BuildSystem">C++ 2D/3D engine</a> for games and simulations.

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
The idea was to create an MMORPG with a life-science background, first it started out as 
a training exercise in programming. But along the way the project grew and grew and 
soon i ended up with a basic client and server model supporting ~200 users online. Later 
on it occurred to me that it would perhaps be possible to have client-code open-source 
to see how many people are interested in developing it further.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
This idea led to the development of a server (storing information about clients) in charge of managing 
and monitoring the game. The server is at the moment composed of the following parts:<br>
<b>Server status</b><br>
- Basic file I/O<br>
- Monitor & accept incoming connections<br>
- Creating new users<br>
- Managing user movement<br>
- Managing user chat<br>
- Object collision<br>
- First 'AI'<br>

<b>Client status</b><br>
- Basic file I/O<br>
- Create accounts on server<br>
- Log into the game world<br>
- Viewing the World in 3D<br>
- Movement<br>
- Chat with other players<br>
- View other players movement<br>
- Camera movement in 3D<br>
- Basic object interaction<br>

section to get an impression of the game and its current stage
of development
