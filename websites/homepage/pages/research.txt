Have you ever wondered why some people have blue eyes and others green?
Why some of us get flu every year and other almost never?</p>
<p>
These are the questions that got me interested in biology around 2003.
We currently know that the answer to these question can be found in our DNA. Traits 
(e.g. flu susceptibility, hair color and length) are encoded on your personal DNA molecules, stored in every nucleus of every living cell.
In our DNA all our traits are encoded by using only a four letter alphabet. A word in this 
code is called a gene, and humans have an estimated 50.000 genes. This alphabet is on demand 
transcribed into RNA, which in its turn is turned into proteins.
</p>
<p>
These proteins (and the products they produce) are causing traits we observe, unraveling the relation between 
genetic variation (having different genes) and the traits we observe is called 'Quantitative Genetics'.

For my PHD I'm researching methods to 'frame' the DNA, linking the code to the traits we see. Because I am a 
biologist I work on questions involving plant traits. Increasing their yield, resistance and other useful 
properties. For this I collaborate with Wageningen University where they have a biology department which grows 
Arabidopsis (Model) plants. The data coming from these plants is huge Hard drives full of numbers, representing 
the activity of all genes. This data is then analyzed by GBIC our lab. This is because in Groningen the 
infrastructure needed to analyze these big amounts of data is available.
