<h1>Danny Arends</h1>
<p>
  I'm Danny Arends and I'm a PHD student at GBIC which is part of the University of 
  Groningen. Also I'm working part-time for the hospital at the Genomics Coordination 
  Centre. Welcome to the index of my home page, where I show my work and keep a blog 
  about my personal life.
</p>
<p>
  For work I develop new methodology and create software for use in biology research.
  The focus of my PHD thesis is on computational methods in quantitative trait (QTL) 
  analysis. People interested can read more about that in the <a href='index.cgi?p=publications'>publications</a> section or on my <a href='index.cgi?p=blog'>blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This web site however is setup to be more broad than just focus on what I do for work. So 
  I also show my passion for software visualization, I have setup a few screen shots of my C++ 
  rendering engine, more can be found at my Github code storage. Also you can 
  <a href='index.cgi?p=oldgames'>download the old games</a> I used to enjoy playing when I was 
  younger, or look at my <a href='index.cgi?p=oscar' title='Oscar my cat'>my cat</a>.
