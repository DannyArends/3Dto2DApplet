<h1>Danny Arends</h1>
<p>
  I'm Danny Arends and I'm a PHD student at the Groningen Bioinformatics Centre which is 
  part of the University of Groningen. Also I'm working part-time for the hospital in 
  Groningen at the Genomics Coordination Centre. The focus of my research is development of 
  novel algorithms in computational biology</p>
<p>
  For my work I develop new methodologies and create software for use in biology research,
  the focus of my PHD thesis is on computational methods in quantitative trait analysis (QTL). 
  People interested can read more about that in the <a href='index.cgi?p=publications'>publications</a> section or on my <a href='index.cgi?p=blog'>blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This web site however is setup to be more broad than just focus on what I do for work. So 
  I also show my passion for software visualization, I have setup a few screen shots of my C++ 
  rendering engine, more can be found at my Github code storage. Also you can

  younger, or look at my <a href='index.cgi?p=oscar' title='Oscar my cat'>my cat</a>.
