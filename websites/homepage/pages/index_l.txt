<h3>About Danny</h3>
Welcome to my web site, first let me introduce myself. I'm Danny Arends and I'm a PHD student bioinformatics at the Groningen Bioinformatics Centre which is a part of the University of Groningen. For my work I create software for use in biology research, the focus of my PHD thesis is on computational methods in quantitative trait analysis. People interested can read more about that in the publications section. 
This web site however is setup to be more broad than just focus on what i do for work. 
So if you want to know more about me, I welcome you to visit the other sections as well like:
