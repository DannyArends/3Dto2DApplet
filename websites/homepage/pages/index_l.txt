<h3>About Danny</h3>
Welcome to my web site, first let me introduce myself. I'm Danny Arends and I'm a PHD student 
bioinformatics at the Groningen Bioinformatics Centre which is a part of the University of Groningen. 
For my work I create software for use in biology research, the focus of my PHD thesis is on 
computational methods in quantitative trait analysis (QTL). People interested can read more about 
that in the publications section or on my blog. This web site however is setup to be more broad than just 
focus on what I do for work. So i aso show my passion for software visualization, and keep a blog of my life.
So if you want to know more about me, I welcome you to visit the other sections as well like:
