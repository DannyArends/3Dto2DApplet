<h3>Game design</h3>
One of my longest hobbies, computer games and how 2D / 3D rendering engines work inspired me to create my own <a href="http://www.github.com/DannyArends/BuildSystem">C++ 2D/3D engine</a> for games and simulations.

<b>Why</b>
The idea was to create an MMORPG with a life-science background, first it started out as a training excersise in programming. But along the way the project grew and grew and soon i ended up with a basic client and server model supporting ~200 users online. Lateron it occured to me that it would perhaps be possible to have client-code open-source to see how many people are intrested in developing it further.

<b>Implementation</b>
This idea led to the development of a server (storing information about clients) in charge of managing and monitoring the game. The server is at the moment composed of the following parts:

<b>Server status</b>
- Basic file I/O
- Monitor & accept incomming connections
- Creating new users
- Managing user movement
- Managing user chat
- Object collision
- First 'AI'

<b>Client status</b>
- Basic file I/O
- Create accounts on server
- Log into the gameworld
- Viewing the World in 3D
- Movement
- Chat with other players
- View other players movement
- Camera movement in 3D
- Basic object interaction
