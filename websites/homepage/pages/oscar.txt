<h1>Oscar my cat</h1>
<p>
Oscar is the cat that I caught when he was trying to hide behind a garbage container.
He had been there with his Mom and 2 sisters for  around 10 weeks or so, when we caught sight 
of the white panda cat. After a short hide n seek together with Jordy Tolk I caught him 
and one of his sisters. His mom and the remaining little cat were picked up by the animal 
health care, but Oscar went home with me, and has been mooching food and drinks off me 
since May 2008...
